Users may want to directly call three functions in particular: `Clenshaw_Curtis_quad` and `Gauss_Legendre_quad` generate the quadrature nodes and weights for $\\mu$ integration from $-1$ to $1$, and $\\phi$ integration from $0$ to $2\\pi$ respectively. The third function `generate_FD_mat` generates a sparse first derivative matrix with second-order accuracy.

We actually constructed `mu_arr` in the blackbody radiation example we provided for section [1.7](#1.7-OPTIONAL:-Choose-other-internal-sources). Both `flux_up` $(F^+)$ and `flux_down` $(F^-)$ accept only one argument, $\\tau$, and return the diffuse fluxes at the specified optical depths in the upward and downward directions respectively. The latter also returns the direct flux as its second output. More details on the flux functions can be found in section [3.8](#3.8-Computation-of-flux). The distinction between \"direct\" and \"diffuse\" is explained in the preamble, above section [1](#1.-USER-INPUT-REQUIRED:-Choose-parameters). \n",

The function output is 3D and axes $0, 1, 2$ capture $\\mu, \\tau, \\phi$ variation respectively. The first half of the $\\mu$ indices correspond to $u^+$ (upward) and the second half to $u^-$ (downward) in alignment with `mu_arr`. Finally, note the optional flag `return_Fourier_error` which defaults to `False`, see section [3.7](#3.7-The-full-solution) for more details."

The main consideration when choosing the number of streams is the mostly empirical observation that $\\text{NQuad} < \\text{NLeg}$ results in large errors, see [[1]](#cite-Cha1960) and [[4]](#cite-STWLE2000). The reasons for this are not well understood, though we note that Gauss-Legendre quadrature with $N$ nodes is able to integrate polynomials of up to order $2N-1$ exactly, and that is the order of $D^m$."

Therefore, we introduced the parameter $\\text{NLoops}$ for the user to choose the number of Fourier modes to use in constructing the full solution. It is so named because our solver is looped $\\text{NLoops}$ times for each atmospheric layer. In PyDISORT $\\text{NLoops}$ must be guessed or tuned. In Stamnes' DISORT, $\\text{NLoops}$ is chosen adaptively, though a little crudely, using the Cauchy convergence criterion, see [[4, section 3.7]](#cite-STWLE2000). In PyDISORT, that same Cauchy / Fourier convergence evaluation will be printed for the last $(m = \\text{NLoops})$ Fourier term if the optional flag `return_Fourier_error = True` is passed to $u$, see section [3.7](#3.7-The-full-solution) in this notebook."

Performing the interpolation this way, using Legendre points, convergence is guaranteed as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$, see [[10, chapter 8]](#cite-Tre1996). \n",

Second, intensity values very near the sunbeam remain inaccurate despite NT corrections, so one may be concerned about including them in the interpolation. Finally, using a high-order polynomial for interpolation is expensive, unstable and sensitive to errors in the interpolation points. Thus, even though Runge phenomenon is not a concern, one may want to consider other methods of interpolation, or to not interpolate at all and just use the values at $\\mu_i$ especially when $\\text{NQuad}$ is large."

It is found that truncation of the phase function causes a significant error in the computed intensity and the magnitude of this error depends significantly on how the intensity is retrieved from the truncated radiative transfer equation. A newly developed retrieval algorithm, the TMS- method, yields the intensity field with an error ⪅1% when the number of discrete path is as small as 10 in the hemisphere for aerosol-laden atmospheres with optical thickness ⪅1.}\n",

    "abstract = {Radiative heat transfer in water clouds is studied by the method of discrete ordinates, taking into account not only scattering, absorption and emission by cloud droplets but also absorption and emission by water vapor in the cloud. According to Semuelson the method of discrete ordinates is not very amenable to studies involving the intermediate optical thickness, because of instabilities that are inherent in the method for the intermediate optical thickness. A method of avoiding these instabilities is shown in this paper. Numerical calculation for the spectral region from 5 to 40 μ was carried out on the model altostratus clouds, and that only for the window region on the model stratocumulus and nimbostratus clouds. The radiative temperature change in a very thin cloud is everywhere cooling. With increasing cloud thickness, however, the upper parts of the cloud undergo cooling, while the lower parts undergo heating. The rate of both heating and cooling is largest near the surface. In a semi-infinitely thick cloud the cloud top undergoes cooling at a rate of about 30°C/hr and effective cooling extends to about 100 m interior from the cloud boundary.}\n",

    "abstract = {We summarize an advanced, thoroughly documented, and quite general purpose discrete ordinate algorithm for time-independent transfer calculations in vertically inhomogeneous, nonisothermal, plane-parallel media. Atmospheric applications ranging from the UV to the radar region of the electromagnetic spectrum are possible. The physical processes included are thermal emission, scattering, absorption, and bidirectional reflection and emissionat the lower boundary. The medium may be forced at the top boundary by parallel or diffuse radiation and by internal and boundary thermal sources as well. We provide a brief account of the theoretical basis as well as a discussion of the numerical implementation of the theory. The recent advances made by ourselves and our collaborators---advances in both formulation and numerical solution---are all incorporated in the algorithm. Prominent among these advances are the complete conquest of two ill-conditioning problems which afflicted all previous discrete ordinate implementations: (1) the computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors and (2) the inversion of the matrix determining the constants of integration. Copies of the fortran program on microcomputer diskettes are available for interested users.},\n",

The solution yields fluxes, as well as the complete azimuthal dependence of the intensity at any level in the atmosphere. The numerical aspects of the solution are discussed and numerical verification is provided by comparing computed results with those obtained by other methods. In particular, it is shown that a simple scaling scheme, which removes the positive exponentials in the coefficient matrix when solving for the constants of integration, provides unconditionally stable solutions for arbitrary optical thicknesses. An assessment of the accuracy to be expected is also provided, and it is shown that low-order discrete ordinate approximations yield very accurate flux values.}\n",

    "abstract = {In previous work, we derived the adjoint method as a computationally efficient path to three-dimensional (3D) retrievals of clouds and aerosols. In this paper we will demonstrate the use of adjoint methods for retrieving two-dimensional (2D) fields of cloud extinction. The demonstration uses a new 2D radiative transfer solver (FSDOM). This radiation code was augmented with adjoint methods to allow efficient derivative calculations needed to retrieve cloud and surface properties from multi-angle reflectance measurements. The code was then used in three synthetic retrieval studies. Our retrieval algorithm adjusts the cloud extinction field and surface albedo to minimize the measurement misfit function with a gradient-based, quasi-Newton approach. At each step we compute the value of the misfit function and its gradient with two calls to the solver FSDOM. First we solve the forward radiative transfer equation to compute the residual misfit with measurements, and second we solve the adjoint radiative transfer equation to compute the gradient of the misfit function with respect to all unknowns. The synthetic retrieval studies verify that adjoint methods are scalable to retrieval problems with many measurements and unknowns. We can retrieve the vertically-integrated optical depth of moderately thick clouds as a function of the horizontal coordinate. It is also possible to retrieve the vertical profile of clouds that are separated by clear regions. The vertical profile retrievals improve for smaller cloud fractions. This leads to the conclusion that cloud edges actually increase the amount of information that is available for retrieving the vertical profile of clouds. However, to exploit this information one must retrieve the horizontally heterogeneous cloud properties with a 2D (or 3D) model. This prototype shows that adjoint methods can efficiently compute the gradient of the misfit function. This work paves the way for the application of similar methods to 3D remote sensing problems.}\n",

    "abstract = {This paper derives an efficient procedure for using the three-dimensional (3D) vector radiative transfer equation (VRTE) to adjust atmosphere and surface properties and improve their fit with multi-angle/multi-pixel radiometric and polarimetric measurements of scattered sunlight. The proposed adjoint method uses the 3D VRTE to compute the measurement misfit function and the adjoint 3D VRTE to compute its gradient with respect to all unknown parameters. In the remote sensing problems of interest, the scalar-valued misfit function quantifies agreement with data as a function of atmosphere and surface properties, and its gradient guides the search through this parameter space. Remote sensing of the atmosphere and surface in a three-dimensional region may require thousands of unknown parameters and millions of data points. Many approaches would require calls to the 3D VRTE solver in proportion to the number of unknown parameters or measurements. To avoid this issue of scale, we focus on computing the gradient of the misfit function as an alternative to the Jacobian of the measurement operator. The resulting adjoint method provides a way to adjust 3D atmosphere and surface properties with only two calls to the 3D VRTE solver for each spectral channel, regardless of the number of retrieval parameters, measurement view angles or pixels. This gives a procedure for adjusting atmosphere and surface parameters that will scale to the large problems of 3D remote sensing. For certain types of multi-angle/multi-pixel polarimetric measurements, this encourages the development of a new class of three-dimensional retrieval algorithms with more flexible parametrizations of spatial heterogeneity, less reliance on data screening procedures, and improved coverage in terms of the resolved physical processes in the Earth׳s atmosphere.}\n",

    "abstract = {A successor version 3 of DISORT (DISORT3) is presented with important upgrades that improve the accuracy, efficiency, and stability of the algorithm. Compared with version 2 (DISORT2 released in 2000) these upgrades include (a) a redesigned BRDF computation that improves both speed and accuracy, (b) a revised treatment of the single scattering correction, and (c) additional efficiency and stability upgrades for beam sources. In DISORT3 the BRDF computation is improved in the following three ways: (i) the Fourier decomposition is prepared “off-line”, thus avoiding the repeated internal computations done in DISORT2; (ii) a large enough number of terms in the Fourier expansion of the BRDF is employed to guarantee accurate values of the expansion coefficients (default is 200 instead of 50 in DISORT2); (iii) in the post-processing step the reflection of the direct attenuated beam from the lower boundary is included resulting in a more accurate single scattering correction. These improvements in the treatment of the BRDF have led to improved accuracy and a several-fold increase in speed. In addition, the stability of beam sources has been improved by removing a singularity occurring when the cosine of the incident beam angle is too close to the reciprocal of any of the eigenvalues. The efficiency for beam sources has been further improved from reducing by a factor of 2 (compared to DISORT2) the dimension of the linear system of equations that must be solved to obtain the particular solutions, and by replacing the LINPAK routines used in DISORT2 by LAPACK 3.5 in DISORT3. These beam source stability and efficiency upgrades bring enhanced stability and an additional 5–7% improvement in speed. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate and quantify the improvements in accuracy and efficiency of DISORT3 compared to DISORT2.}\n",

    "\tabstract = {The interplay of sunlight with clouds is a ubiquitous and often pleasant visual experience, but it conjures up major challenges for weather, climate, environmental science and beyond. Those engaged in the characterization of clouds (and the clear air nearby) by remote sensing methods are even more confronted. The problem comes, on the one hand, from the spatial complexity of real clouds and, on the other hand, from the dominance of multiple scattering in the radiation transport. The former ingredient contrasts sharply with the still popular representation of clouds as homogeneous plane-parallel slabs for the purposes of radiative transfer computations. In typical cloud scenes the opposite asymptotic transport regimes of diffusion and ballistic propagation coexist. We survey the three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric radiative transfer literature over the past 50 years and identify three concurrent and intertwining thrusts: first, how to assess the damage (bias) caused by 3D effects in the operational 1D radiative transfer models? Second, how to mitigate this damage? Finally, can we exploit 3D radiative transfer phenomena to innovate observation methods and technologies? We quickly realize that the smallest scale resolved computationally or observationally may be artificial but is nonetheless a key quantity that separates the 3D radiative transfer solutions into two broad and complementary classes: stochastic and deterministic. Both approaches draw on classic and contemporary statistical, mathematical and computational physics.}\n",
