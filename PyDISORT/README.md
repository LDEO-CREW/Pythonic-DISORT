Solves the (1D) Radiative Transfer Equation for a multilayer atmospheric layer using the Discrete Ordinates Method. 
Coded entirely in Python. 
Based on Stamnes' DISORT (see reference in Jupyter Notebook) and has its main features: e.g. delta-M scaling, Nakajima-Tanaka (NT) corrections, only flux option, blackbody radiation source etc.
Also includes a Jupyter Notebook with comprehensive explanations on the inner workings of the algorithm.
The notebook includes mathematical derivations and verification tests (separate from the tests implemented using pytest).
