abstract = {We summarize an advanced, thoroughly documented, and quite general purpose discrete ordinate algorithm for time-independent transfer calculations in vertically inhomogeneous, nonisothermal, plane-parallel media. Atmospheric applications ranging from the UV to the radar region of the electromagnetic spectrum are possible. The physical processes included are thermal emission, scattering, absorption, and bidirectional reflection and emissionat the lower boundary. The medium may be forced at the top boundary by parallel or diffuse radiation and by internal and boundary thermal sources as well. We provide a brief account of the theoretical basis as well as a discussion of the numerical implementation of the theory. The recent advances made by ourselves and our collaborators---advances in both formulation and numerical solution---are all incorporated in the algorithm. Prominent among these advances are the complete conquest of two ill-conditioning problems which afflicted all previous discrete ordinate implementations: (1) the computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors and (2) the inversion of the matrix determining the constants of integration. Copies of the fortran program on microcomputer diskettes are available for interested users.},

abstract = {Two tools for the solution of radiative transfer problems are presented. Streamer is a flexible medium spectral resolution radiative transfer model based on the plane-parallel theory of radiative transfer. Capable of computing either fluxes or radiances, it is suitable for studying radiative processes at the surface or within the atmosphere and for the development of remote-sensing algorithms. FluxNet is a fast neural network-based implementation of Streamer for computing surface fluxes. It allows for a sophisticated treatment of radiative processes in the analysis of large data sets and potential integration into geophysical models where computational efficiency is an issue. Documentation and tools for the development of alternative versions of FluxNet are available. Collectively, Streamer and FluxNet solve a wide variety of problems related to radiative transfer: Streamer provides the detail and sophistication needed to perform basic research on most aspects of complex radiative processes, whereas the efficiency and simplicity of FluxNet make it ideal for operational use.}

The errors in the approximate values of the source-function and the limb-darkening in all three methods are tabulated for various approximations, and illustrated by graphs.}",
