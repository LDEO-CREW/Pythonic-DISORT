abstract = {Abstract Current satellite cloud products from passive radiometers provide effective single-layer cloud properties by assuming a homogeneous cloud in a pixel, resulting in inevitable biases when multiple-layer clouds are present in a vertical column. We devise a novel method to retrieve cloud vertical properties for ice-over-water clouds using passive radiometers. Based on the absorptivity differences of liquid water and ice clouds at four shortwave-infrared channels (centered at 0.87, 1.61, 2.13, and 2.25 μm), cloud optical thicknesses (COT) and effective radii of both upper-layer ice and lower-layer liquid water clouds are inferred simultaneously. The algorithm works most effectively for clouds with ice COT < 7 and liquid water COT > 5. The simulated spectral reflectances based on our retrieved ice-over-water clouds become more consistent with observations than those with a single-layer assumption. This new algorithm will improve our understanding of clouds, and we suggest that these four cloud channels should be all included in future satellite sensors.},

abstract = {Satellite monitoring of aerosol properties using passive techniques is widely considered a crucial tool for the study of climatic effects of atmospheric particulate [Kaufman et al., 1997]. Only space-based observations can provide the required global coverage information on spatial distribution and temporal variation of the aerosol field. This paper describes a method for deriving aerosol optical thickness at 500 nm and aerosol type from Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) data over the ocean under cloud-free conditions. GOME, flying on board the second European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS 2) since April 1995, is a spectrometer that measures radiation reflected from Earth in the spectral range 240–793 nm. The features of the instrument relevant to the aerosol retrieval task are its high relative radiometric accuracy (better than 1\%), its spectral coverage, and its spectral resolution, which allows wavelengths in spectral regions free of molecular absorption (atmospheric windows) to be selected. The method presented is based on a pseudo-inversion approach in which measured reflectance spectra are fitted to simulated equivalents computed using a suitable radiative transfer model. The crucial aspects of this method are the high accuracy and the nonapproximate nature of the radiative transfer model, which simulates the spectra during the fitting procedure, and careful selection of candidate aerosol classes. A test application of the proposed method to a Saharan dust outbreak which occurred in June 1997 is presented, showing that in spite of the instrument's low spatial resolution, information on both optical thickness and spectral characterization of the aerosol can be retrieved from GOME data. Preliminary comparisons of the results with independent estimates of the aerosol content show that a good correlation exists, encouraging planning of a systematic application of the method.},

Atmospheric applications ranging from the UV to the radar region of the electromagnetic spectrum are possible. The physical processes included are thermal emission, scattering, absorption, and bidirectional reflection and emissionat the lower boundary. The medium may be forced at the top boundary by parallel or diffuse radiation and by internal and boundary thermal sources as well. We provide a brief account of the theoretical basis as well as a discussion of the numerical implementation of the theory. The recent advances made by ourselves and our collaborators---advances in both formulation and numerical solution---are all incorporated in the algorithm. Prominent among these advances are the complete conquest of two ill-conditioning problems which afflicted all previous discrete ordinate implementations: (1) the computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors and (2) the inversion of the matrix determining the constants of integration. Copies of the fortran program on microcomputer diskettes are available for interested users.},

abstract = {Two tools for the solution of radiative transfer problems are presented. Streamer is a flexible medium spectral resolution radiative transfer model based on the plane-parallel theory of radiative transfer. Capable of computing either fluxes or radiances, it is suitable for studying radiative processes at the surface or within the atmosphere and for the development of remote-sensing algorithms. FluxNet is a fast neural network-based implementation of Streamer for computing surface fluxes. It allows for a sophisticated treatment of radiative processes in the analysis of large data sets and potential integration into geophysical models where computational efficiency is an issue. Documentation and tools for the development of alternative versions of FluxNet are available. Collectively, Streamer and FluxNet solve a wide variety of problems related to radiative transfer: Streamer provides the detail and sophistication needed to perform basic research on most aspects of complex radiative processes, whereas the efficiency and simplicity of FluxNet make it ideal for operational use.}
