    "The solver function `pydisort` will always return `mu_arr` (type: array), `flux_up` (type: function), `flux_down` (type: function) and `u0` (type: function). The array `mu_arr` contains the $\\mu_i$ values, i.e. the $\\mu$ quadrature nodes. Input `tau` $\\tau$ into `flux_up` $F^+$ and `flux_down` $F^-$ to get the diffuse fluxes at the specified optical depths. The latter also returns the direct flux as its second output. More details on the flux functions can be found in section [3.8](#3.8-Computation-of-flux). The distinction between \"direct\" and \"diffuse\" is explained in the introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `u0` $u^0$ is the zeroth Fourier moment of the (diffuse) intensity, i.e. the azimuthal average, and it is continuous and variable in $\\tau$ but discrete in $\\mu$ and fixed to the quadrature points $\\mu_i$. The function output is 2D and its $0, 1$ axes capture variation with $\\mu$ and $\\tau$ respectively. The first half of the $\\mu$ indices correspond to the upward direction and the second half to the downward direction in alignment with `mu_arr`. This function is useful for calculating actinic flux and other intensity moments, but reclassification of delta-scaled flux (see section [3.8.1](#3.8.1-Impact-of-delta-M-scaling-on-flux-calculations)) and other corrections must be done manually (actinic flux can be calculated by inputing `u0` into `PythonicDISORT.subroutines.generate_diff_act_flux_funcs` and the flux reclassification will be automatic).\n",
    "\n",
    "When `only_flux = False` (default), `pydisort` will also output the intensity function `u` $u$ which is continuous and variable in $\\tau$ and $\\phi$, which are its arguments, but discrete in $\\mu$ and fixed to the quadrature points $\\mu_i$. The function output is 3D and its $0, 1, 2$ axes capture variation with $\\mu, \\tau, \\phi$ respectively. The function also has the optional flag `return_Fourier_error` which defaults to `False`, see section [3.7](#3.7-The-full-solution) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these functions has the optional flag `indefinite_tau_integral` (defaults to `False`) which if set to `True` switches to  an antiderivative of the function with respect to $\\tau$. For example, `flux_up(tau0, is_antiderivative_wrt_tau=True) - flux_up(0, is_antiderivative_wrt_tau=True)` will give the integral of `flux_up` over $\\tau \\in [0, \\tau_0]$."

Increasing $\\text{NQuad}$ past the threshold generally results in better accuracy, though monotone convergence is not guaranteed when using the double-Gauss quadrature scheme, see [[7]](#cite-Syk1951) for a discussion on the convergence of different quadrature schemes. Given, however, that the computational complexity of `pydisort` scales linearly with $\\text{NLeg}$ and cubicly with $\\text{NQuad}$, it is recommended to choose $\\text{NQuad}$ based on the computational resources and time available, then choose $\\text{NLeg} = \\text{NQuad}$.

    "The $\\delta-M$ method allows for accurate flux computation, but intensity values remain inaccurate particularly at backscattering angles and around the direct beam. These inaccuracies are largely caused by truncation of the Legendre series of the phase function. Nakajima and Tanaka proposed intensity corrections to reduce these accuracies. This correction is applied to the intensity but not to the flux as the latter is already accurate. This unfortunately means that flux values calculated by integrating the corrected intensity will differ slightly from values given by the flux functions. Note that NT corrections ignore, or rather have not been derived for, the isotropic internal source $s$, see [[8, section 3.6.3]](#cite-STWLE2000), and they ignore surface reflection, see section [3.7.3](#3.7.3-Verification-and-visualization:-NT-corrected)."

    "PythonicDISORT has been optimized for speed over memory usage. The output functions store multiple tensors, the largest of which has dimensions $\\text{NFourier} \\times \\text{NLayers} \\times \\text{NQuad} \\times \\text{NQuad}$. When $u$ is called, a tensor of dimensions $\\text{NFourier} \\times \\text{Ntau} \\times \\text{NQuad} \\times \\text{NQuad}$ is constructed, where $\\text{Ntau}$ is the length of the $\\tau$ input and is in general large. A more memory efficient method would be to input the $\\tau$ and $\\phi$ values into `pydisort` and have the output be the solution evaluated at those values rather than a function. This is how Stamnes' DISORT works [[1]](#cite-STWJ1988). This way, the largest tensor that PythonicDISORT needs to construct will have dimensions $\\text{Ntau} \\times \\text{NQuad} \\times \\text{NQuad}$, but the tradeoff will be less speed and flexibility. Even within our current design paradigm there are avenues for memory optimization. Depending on the phase function of each atmospheric layer, the $\\text{NFourier} \\times \\text{NLayers} \\times \\text{NQuad} \\times \\text{NQuad}$ tensor may be sparse. Therefore, it may be beneficial to implement a sparse tensor framework or otherwise memory efficient variants of PythonicDISORT."

There are three factors which significantly slow PythonicDISORT down relative to Stamnes' DISORT. First, Python inherently has more overhead than FORTRAN. This cannot be helped. Second, PythonicDISORT has for-loops over the atmospheric layers $l$ and over the Fourier modes $m$. We have removed as many for-loops as possible and the most expensive operations have all been vectorized. Removing or speeding up the remaining for-loops should make PythonicDISORT faster. Finally, our current implementation of the NT corrections, especially the TMS correction, seems slow and we hope to further optimize it."

According to Semuelson the method of discrete ordinates is not very amenable to studies involving the intermediate optical thickness, because of instabilities that are inherent in the method for the intermediate optical thickness. A method of avoiding these instabilities is shown in this paper. Numerical calculation for the spectral region from 5 to 40 μ was carried out on the model altostratus clouds, and that only for the window region on the model stratocumulus and nimbostratus clouds. The radiative temperature change in a very thin cloud is everywhere cooling. With increasing cloud thickness, however, the upper parts of the cloud undergo cooling, while the lower parts undergo heating. The rate of both heating and cooling is largest near the surface. In a semi-infinitely thick cloud the cloud top undergoes cooling at a rate of about 30°C/hr and effective cooling extends to about 100 m interior from the cloud boundary.}\n",

Atmospheric applications ranging from the UV to the radar region of the electromagnetic spectrum are possible. The physical processes included are thermal emission, scattering, absorption, and bidirectional reflection and emissionat the lower boundary. The medium may be forced at the top boundary by parallel or diffuse radiation and by internal and boundary thermal sources as well. We provide a brief account of the theoretical basis as well as a discussion of the numerical implementation of the theory. The recent advances made by ourselves and our collaborators---advances in both formulation and numerical solution---are all incorporated in the algorithm. Prominent among these advances are the complete conquest of two ill-conditioning problems which afflicted all previous discrete ordinate implementations: (1) the computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors and (2) the inversion of the matrix determining the constants of integration. Copies of the fortran program on microcomputer diskettes are available for interested users.},\n",

The solution yields fluxes, as well as the complete azimuthal dependence of the intensity at any level in the atmosphere. The numerical aspects of the solution are discussed and numerical verification is provided by comparing computed results with those obtained by other methods. In particular, it is shown that a simple scaling scheme, which removes the positive exponentials in the coefficient matrix when solving for the constants of integration, provides unconditionally stable solutions for arbitrary optical thicknesses. An assessment of the accuracy to be expected is also provided, and it is shown that low-order discrete ordinate approximations yield very accurate flux values.}\n",

    "abstract = {In previous work, we derived the adjoint method as a computationally efficient path to three-dimensional (3D) retrievals of clouds and aerosols. In this paper we will demonstrate the use of adjoint methods for retrieving two-dimensional (2D) fields of cloud extinction. The demonstration uses a new 2D radiative transfer solver (FSDOM). This radiation code was augmented with adjoint methods to allow efficient derivative calculations needed to retrieve cloud and surface properties from multi-angle reflectance measurements. The code was then used in three synthetic retrieval studies. Our retrieval algorithm adjusts the cloud extinction field and surface albedo to minimize the measurement misfit function with a gradient-based, quasi-Newton approach. At each step we compute the value of the misfit function and its gradient with two calls to the solver FSDOM. First we solve the forward radiative transfer equation to compute the residual misfit with measurements, and second we solve the adjoint radiative transfer equation to compute the gradient of the misfit function with respect to all unknowns. The synthetic retrieval studies verify that adjoint methods are scalable to retrieval problems with many measurements and unknowns. We can retrieve the vertically-integrated optical depth of moderately thick clouds as a function of the horizontal coordinate. It is also possible to retrieve the vertical profile of clouds that are separated by clear regions. The vertical profile retrievals improve for smaller cloud fractions. This leads to the conclusion that cloud edges actually increase the amount of information that is available for retrieving the vertical profile of clouds. However, to exploit this information one must retrieve the horizontally heterogeneous cloud properties with a 2D (or 3D) model. This prototype shows that adjoint methods can efficiently compute the gradient of the misfit function. This work paves the way for the application of similar methods to 3D remote sensing problems.}\n",

    "abstract = {This paper derives an efficient procedure for using the three-dimensional (3D) vector radiative transfer equation (VRTE) to adjust atmosphere and surface properties and improve their fit with multi-angle/multi-pixel radiometric and polarimetric measurements of scattered sunlight. The proposed adjoint method uses the 3D VRTE to compute the measurement misfit function and the adjoint 3D VRTE to compute its gradient with respect to all unknown parameters. In the remote sensing problems of interest, the scalar-valued misfit function quantifies agreement with data as a function of atmosphere and surface properties, and its gradient guides the search through this parameter space. Remote sensing of the atmosphere and surface in a three-dimensional region may require thousands of unknown parameters and millions of data points. Many approaches would require calls to the 3D VRTE solver in proportion to the number of unknown parameters or measurements. To avoid this issue of scale, we focus on computing the gradient of the misfit function as an alternative to the Jacobian of the measurement operator. The resulting adjoint method provides a way to adjust 3D atmosphere and surface properties with only two calls to the 3D VRTE solver for each spectral channel, regardless of the number of retrieval parameters, measurement view angles or pixels. This gives a procedure for adjusting atmosphere and surface parameters that will scale to the large problems of 3D remote sensing. For certain types of multi-angle/multi-pixel polarimetric measurements, this encourages the development of a new class of three-dimensional retrieval algorithms with more flexible parametrizations of spatial heterogeneity, less reliance on data screening procedures, and improved coverage in terms of the resolved physical processes in the Earth׳s atmosphere.}\n",

    "abstract = {A successor version 3 of DISORT (DISORT3) is presented with important upgrades that improve the accuracy, efficiency, and stability of the algorithm. Compared with version 2 (DISORT2 released in 2000) these upgrades include (a) a redesigned BRDF computation that improves both speed and accuracy, (b) a revised treatment of the single scattering correction, and (c) additional efficiency and stability upgrades for beam sources. In DISORT3 the BRDF computation is improved in the following three ways: (i) the Fourier decomposition is prepared “off-line”, thus avoiding the repeated internal computations done in DISORT2; (ii) a large enough number of terms in the Fourier expansion of the BRDF is employed to guarantee accurate values of the expansion coefficients (default is 200 instead of 50 in DISORT2); (iii) in the post-processing step the reflection of the direct attenuated beam from the lower boundary is included resulting in a more accurate single scattering correction. These improvements in the treatment of the BRDF have led to improved accuracy and a several-fold increase in speed. In addition, the stability of beam sources has been improved by removing a singularity occurring when the cosine of the incident beam angle is too close to the reciprocal of any of the eigenvalues. The efficiency for beam sources has been further improved from reducing by a factor of 2 (compared to DISORT2) the dimension of the linear system of equations that must be solved to obtain the particular solutions, and by replacing the LINPAK routines used in DISORT2 by LAPACK 3.5 in DISORT3. These beam source stability and efficiency upgrades bring enhanced stability and an additional 5–7% improvement in speed. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate and quantify the improvements in accuracy and efficiency of DISORT3 compared to DISORT2.}\n",

    "\tabstract = {The interplay of sunlight with clouds is a ubiquitous and often pleasant visual experience, but it conjures up major challenges for weather, climate, environmental science and beyond. Those engaged in the characterization of clouds (and the clear air nearby) by remote sensing methods are even more confronted. The problem comes, on the one hand, from the spatial complexity of real clouds and, on the other hand, from the dominance of multiple scattering in the radiation transport. The former ingredient contrasts sharply with the still popular representation of clouds as homogeneous plane-parallel slabs for the purposes of radiative transfer computations. In typical cloud scenes the opposite asymptotic transport regimes of diffusion and ballistic propagation coexist. We survey the three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric radiative transfer literature over the past 50 years and identify three concurrent and intertwining thrusts: first, how to assess the damage (bias) caused by 3D effects in the operational 1D radiative transfer models? Second, how to mitigate this damage? Finally, can we exploit 3D radiative transfer phenomena to innovate observation methods and technologies? We quickly realize that the smallest scale resolved computationally or observationally may be artificial but is nonetheless a key quantity that separates the 3D radiative transfer solutions into two broad and complementary classes: stochastic and deterministic. Both approaches draw on classic and contemporary statistical, mathematical and computational physics.}\n",
