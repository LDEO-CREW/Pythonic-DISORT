# Introduction
The PythonicDISORT package is a Discrete Ordinates Solver for the (1D) Radiative Transfer Equation 
in a plane-parallel, horizontally homogeneous atmosphere.
It is coded entirely in Python 3 and is a reimplementation instead of a wrapper.
While PythonicDISORT has been optimized for speed, it will naturally be slower than similar FORTRAN algorithms.
On the other hand, PythonicDISORT should be easier to install, use, and modify than FORTRAN-based Discrete Ordinates Solvers.

PythonicDISORT is based on Stamnes' FORTRAN DISORT (see References, in particular [2, 3, 8]) and has its main features: multi-layer solver, 
delta-M scaling, Nakajima-Tanaka (NT) corrections, only flux option, direct beam source, isotropic internal source (blackbody emission), 
Dirichlet boundary conditions (diffuse flux boundary sources), Bi-Directional Reflectance Function (BDRF) for surface reflection, and more.
In addition, subroutine to calculate actinic fluxes was added to satisfy a user request and further feature requests as well as feedback are welcome.

# Documentation
https://pythonic-disort.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Also see the accompanying Jupyter Notebook `Pythonic-DISORT.ipynb` in the `docs` directory
of our GitHub repository.
This Jupyter Notebook provides comprehensive documentation, suggested inputs, explanations, 
mathematical derivations and verification tests.
It is highly recommended that new users read the non-optional parts of sections 1 and 2.

## PyTest and examples of how to use PythonicDISORT

Not only are there verification tests in `Pythonic-DISORT.ipynb`, 
most of the test problems in Stamnes' `disotest.f90` (download DISORT 4.0.99 from http://www.rtatmocn.com/disort/) have also been recreated.
In these tests, the solutions from PythonicDISORT are compared against solutions 
from a F2PY-wrapped Stamnes' DISORT (version 4.0.99; wrapper inspired by https://github.com/kconnour/pyRT_DISORT). With PyTest installed, execute the console command `pytest` 
in the `pydisotest` directory to run these tests. The `pydisotest` directory also contains Jupyter Notebooks that correspond to each test
to show how it was implemented. These notebooks double up as examples of how to use PythonicDISORT.

# Installation

* From PyPI: `pip install PythonicDISORT`
* From Conda-forge: (TODO: need to first publish on Conda-forge)
* By cloning repository: `pip install .` in the `Pythonic-DISORT` directory; `pip install -r all_optional_dependencies.txt` to install all optional dependencies (see *Requirements to run PythonicDISORT*)

## Requirements to run PythonicDISORT
* Python 3.8+
* `numpy >= 1.8.0`
* `scipy >= 1.8.0`
* (OPTIONAL) `pytest >= 6.2.5` (Required to use the command `pytest`, see *PyTest and examples of how to use PythonicDISORT*)

## (OPTIONAL) Additional requirements to run the Jupyter Notebook
* `autograd >= 1.5`
* `jupyter > 1.0.0`
* `notebook > 6.5.2`
* `matplotlib >= 3.6.0`

In addition, a F2PY-wrapped Stamnes' DISORT, or equivalent, is required to properly run the last section (section 6).

## Compatibility

The PythonicDISORT package should be system agnostic given its minimal dependencies and pure Python code.
Everything in the repository was built and tested on Windows 11.
