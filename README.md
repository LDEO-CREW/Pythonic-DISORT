Solves the (1D) Radiative Transfer Equation for a multilayer atmospheric layer using the Discrete Ordinates Method. 
Coded entirely in Python. 
Based on Stamnes' DISORT (see reference in Jupyter Notebook) and has its main features: e.g. delta-M scaling, Nakajima-Tanaka (NT) corrections, only flux option, blackbody radiation source etc.

Find the accompanying Jupyter Notebook (Pythonic-DISORT.ipynb) at https://github.com/Maths2209/Pythonic-DISORT.
The Jupyter Notebook provides comprehensive documentation, suggested inputs, explanations, 
mathematical derivations and verification tests (separate from the tests implemented using pytest).
We highly recommend reading the non-optional parts of sections 1 and 2 before use.
