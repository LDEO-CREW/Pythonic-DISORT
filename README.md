# Introduction
The PythonicDISORT package is a Discrete Ordinates Solver for the (1D) Radiative Transfer Equation in a single or multi-layer atmosphere.
It is coded entirely in Python 3 and in as "Pythonic" a manner as possible: we vectorize as well as use list comprehension and `map` as much as possible. 

PythonicDISORT is based on Stamnes' FORTRAN DISORT (see References, in particular [2, 3, 8]) and has its main features: 
delta-M scaling, Nakajima-Tanaka (NT) corrections, only flux option, isotropic internal sources (thermal source),
Bi-Directional Reflectance Function (BDRF) and more.

This repository also includes our F2PY-wrapped Stamnes DISORT (version 4.0.99) in the `disort4.0.99_f2py` directory.
The original was downloaded from http://www.rtatmocn.com/disort/. The wrapper was inspired by https://github.com/kconnour/pyRT_DISORT.

# Documentation
https://pythonic-disort.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Also see the accompanying Jupyter Notebook: `Pythonic-DISORT.ipynb` in the `docs` directory 
at https://github.com/LDEO-CREW/Pythonic-DISORT.
The Jupyter Notebook provides comprehensive documentation, suggested inputs, explanations, 
mathematical derivations and verification tests.
We highly recommend reading the non-optional parts of sections 1 and 2 before use.

## PyTest

Separate from the notebook verification tests, we used PyTest to recreate most of the test problems from Stamnes et. al.'s `disotest.f90`.
With PyTest installed, execute the console command `pytest` in the `pydisotest` directory to run these tests.

# Installation

* From PyPI: `pip install PythonicDISORT`
* From Conda-forge: (TODO: we need to first publish on Conda-forge)
* By cloning repository: `pip install .` in the `Pythonic-DISORT` directory; `pip install -r all_optional_dependencies.txt` to install all optional dependencies

## Requirements to run PythonicDISORT
* Python 3.8+
* `numpy >= 1.17.3`
* `scipy >= 1.8.0`
* (OPTIONAL) `pytest >= 6.2.5`

## Additional requirements to run the Jupyter Notebook
* `autograd >= 1.5`
* `jupyter > 1.0.0`
* `notebook > 6.5.2`
* (OPTIONAL) `ipympl >= 0.8.8`

In addition, our F2PY-wrapped Stamnes' DISORT (in the `disort4.0.99_f2py` directory) must be set up to run the last section (section 6).

## Compatibility

The PythonicDISORT package should be system agnostic given its minimal dependencies and pure Python code, 
but we cannot say the same for our Jupyter Notebook and F2PY-wrapped Stamnes' DISORT.
Everything was built and tested on Windows 11 and not yet tested on other systems.
